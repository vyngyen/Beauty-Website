hackathon project w rebekah song pookie 

## Introduction
Hello! This is a project created by Vy Nguyen and Rebekah Song for UWB 2024 AI Hackathon event! This project includes the code in HTML, CSS, and Java Script for our website that we created. The track we decided on was business since Vy has some background in business as a business major at UWB. With limited coding knowledge, we decided to chose the little code track 

## Background / Purpose
With the rise in consumerism and global warming, Rebekah Songs interest in sustainability and enviromental science made her wonder ways she could help the world. We thought of a product us and many others use which is make up and skincare. We noticed that a lot of popular makeup and skincare packaging is not sustainable and ecofriendly, compared to the product in Korea. We decided to make a small website where users can browse popular makeup products and see whether their product will be sustainable for the enviroment in the future. Users can also search for a product and chat with an AI bot to ask questions about the product and ask the pros/con to a certain packaging type and/or why a product is eco friendly or not. 

## Business Track / Predicting Trends
This website may allow users and businesses to check which brands have sustainable packaging. This allows for businesses to keep track and predict trends. We predict that as consumerism and overconsumption gets worse, consumers will lean toward brands and products with more ecofriendly and sustainable packaging. This encourages brands to be innovative in their packaging and create products that are competite, yet ecofriendly.

## Design / How we built it
We designed our website with a simple layout so its easy for the user to use. If you scroll down, you can browse popular products and also search up a brand or product. This makes it easy for the user to find their favorite products. We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build our website! We learned through YouTube tutorials and templates to create our website. Some challenges we ran into was how to implemant Open AI to our website and we ran into some designing problems. Despite all of that, we are very happy with our result! 

## Cybersecurity
Considering the increasing importance of data privacy and security, we have integrated best practices to safeguard user information. While our current version focuses on basic functionality, future iterations will implement robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential threats, ensuring a secure user experience.

## Social Impact
Our platform aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of consumer choices. By highlighting eco-friendly products, we contribute to a greener planet and encourage consumers to make informed decisions. This aligns with global efforts to promote sustainability and reduce the carbon footprint of the beauty industry.

## Feasibility
The project is feasible with current web technologies and can be scaled with additional features such as real-time data analytics, a larger database of products, and integration with e-commerce platforms. Future versions could include user accounts, personalized recommendations, and a community forum for sharing eco-friendly beauty tips.

## Use of AI
The AI chatbot on our website serves as a virtual assistant, guiding users through the product selection process and educating them on environmental friendliness. It uses natural language processing to interpret user inquiries and provide insightful responses. This interactive feature enhances the overall user experience and serves as an educational tool for consumers and businesses. We believe that with an more informed public, we would create a healthier world. 

## Conclusion
We are excited about the potential of our hackathon project to make a positive impact on both the business world and the environment. By leveraging technology and AI, we believe that we can contribute to a future where beauty and sustainability go hand in hand. Thank you for exploring our project!
