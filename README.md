## Inspiration

As two female college students, we immediately recognized an area for improvement in the cosmetics industry. Through our experiences of budgeting and becoming more ethically aware during our time at UW, we've applied these principles to one of our most routine but cherished purchases—cosmetics. As we observed a growing trend among our generation to move away from overconsumption and prioritize sustainability, our inspiration for the project was sparked by the increasing concern over sustainability in the cosmetics industry. With increasing regulations across many industries regarding environmental issues and ethical practices, we recognized the need for a platform that educates consumers about sustainable choices in cosmetics and empowers them to make informed decisions.

## What it does

Our project utilizes AI chatbots to engage consumers in conversations about sustainability and ethical practices in the cosmetics industry. The chatbots provide information about brands' sustainable initiatives, product sourcing, environmental policies, and regulatory compliance. Through interactive dialogue and educational content, the chatbots aim to raise awareness among consumers, particularly younger generations, and influence their purchasing decisions towards more sustainable options.

We also implemented a search system powered by AI-driven data analytics, simplifying the process of accessing sustainability information for makeup products. Our AI technology categorizes the sustainability of each product's packaging, considering factors like recyclability and eco-friendliness. Through this system, users can easily explore the environmental impact of various cosmetics, including details on sourcing, manufacturing practices, and packaging materials. By offering an intuitive platform for consumers to make informed choices, we aim to revolutionize how sustainability data is accessed and utilized in the cosmetics industry.


## How we built it

We built the project using a combination of JavaScript (JS), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to create the website interface. The frontend development involved designing and coding the user interface elements, layout, and styling using HTML and CSS. JavaScript was used to implement interactive features and functionality, such as dynamic content loading and user interactions. Overall, our approach mostly involved frontend technologies to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for accessing sustainability information in the cosmetics industry.

## Challenges we ran into

As beginner-level students with a vision but limited experience, we encountered numerous technical challenges along the way. One significant challenge we faced was sourcing reliable data on cosmetic sustainability practices and regulatory requirements. Despite searching through various sources, we struggled to find the comprehensive and accurate information we needed. This prompted us to take matters into our own hands and personally track down data to create our own database. By doing so, we ensured the accuracy and relevance of the information provided by the chatbots, ultimately overcoming this obstacle through perseverance and resourcefulness. Another significant challenge we encountered was integrating an open API source into our code—a task we had never learned about, heard of, or imagined doing before. Securely incorporating complex AI algorithms while ensuring user-friendly interactions presented technical hurdles that were difficult to troubleshoot. 


## What we learned

One of our major challenges was attempting to integrate an open API source into our project, a task we had never encountered before. Despite our best efforts, we ultimately faced insurmountable difficulties in this integration process. As a result, we had to pivot our approach and explore alternative solutions to achieve our project goals. While we initially aimed to incorporate complex AI algorithms into our platform, we had to acknowledge the limitations of our current knowledge and skill level. Although we were unable to execute this aspect of the project as planned, we learned valuable lessons about the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the face of unexpected challenges. This experience reinforced the notion that setbacks are opportunities for growth and encouraged us to creatively explore different avenues to achieve our objectives.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

One of our proudest accomplishments was our journey from attending the hackathon with no ambition or intention to develop an idea, to successfully conceiving and presenting a unique and creative concept. As beginner-level coders, the idea of implementing AI was foreign to us, but we were inspired by the presentations and guest speakers at the event. Despite our initial confusion, we embraced the challenge and worked tirelessly to make the best of our limited knowledge and skills. We are proud of our ability to adapt and learn quickly, turning our newfound understanding of AI into a feasible and needed project idea. This experience served as our "foot in the door" to combining creative concepts with technical skills, motivating us to further develop our abilities. While there is still much work to be done to fully utilize our technical skills, this experience reinforced our determination and resilience, demonstrating our capacity to learn and grow in a short amount of time without giving up.



## What's next for Cosmetic Sustainability  

Moving forward, the future of cosmetic sustainability holds promise for advancements in technical innovation, strategic business expansion, and meaningful consumer engagement. On the technical front, continuous improvement of AI integration and data analytics optimization is essential for advancing the capabilities of sustainability-focused chatbots. It's possible to refine natural language processing models and algorithms for data analysis, as that would enhance the accuracy and relevance of sustainability assessments for cosmetic products. Additionally, training the development of innovative tools and features within chatbot platforms will improve user experience and engagement. Through these technological advancements, we can leverage AI-driven insights to empower consumers with knowledge about sustainable product choices, inspiring informed decision-making and fostering a culture of conscious consumption.

Businesses can leverage the application not only to enhance their understanding of the competitive landscape but also to promote their own sustainable products, gaining a competitive edge before sustainability laws are enforced by regulatory bodies such as the FDA. By utilizing the AI-driven data analytics capabilities of the platform, businesses can gain valuable insights into the sustainability practices of their competitors, including product sourcing, manufacturing processes, and packaging materials. Companies can use this knowledge to refine their own sustainability strategies, identify areas for improvement, and differentiate themselves in the market by highlighting their commitment to eco-friendly practices. 

Moreover, businesses can capitalize on the platform's consumer engagement features to promote their sustainable products directly to environmentally conscious consumers, establishing themselves as leaders in sustainability and positioning themselves ahead of potential regulatory requirements. By proactively embracing sustainability and leveraging innovative technologies, companies can not only stay ahead of the regulatory curve but also strengthen their market position and brand reputation in an increasingly eco-conscious marketplace.
